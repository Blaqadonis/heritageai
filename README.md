### **About the Creator**
Hi! I'm [ðŸ…±ðŸ…»ðŸ…°ðŸ†€](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinonsoodiaka/), an aspiring AI developer passionate about leveraging technology to preserve cultural heritage. Explore my additional projects on my [Github repositories](https://github.com/Blaqadonis)

### **Project Overview**
Welcome to Heritage, an advanced AI-driven chatbot application crafted to celebrate and explore the rich tapestry of Nigerian arts, culture, and pre-historic heritage. Developed by ðŸ…±ðŸ…»ðŸ…°ðŸ†€ as my submission for Week 1 of the [Agentic AI Developer Certification Program 2025](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/4n07ViGCey0l).
This project showcases an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with LangGraph. Heritage integrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) language models with tool-calling capabilities, enhanced by real-time web access via Tavily, to deliver a dynamic and insightful chatbot experience. Tailored for deep exploration of Nigerian arts, traditions, and history, the system features a modular, customizable architecture, making it adaptable to various domains.

#### **Key Highlights**
* Advanced Model Integration: Utilizes SOTA models with tool-calling abilities, accessed via OpenRouter for cost efficiency, though Heritage is not a free service due to API costs.
* Modular Design: The systemâ€™s theme (currently focused on Nigerian heritage) can be adapted to domains like "Space" or "History" with a compatible knowledge base, thanks to its flexible components.
* Interactive Experience: Offers users an engaging interface for natural language queries, delivering detailed, culturally enriched responses.

### **Introduction**
#### **Purpose**
The primary goal of Heritage is to create an immersive AI query system that educates and engages usersâ€”ranging from Nigerian culture enthusiasts to a global audienceâ€”about the nationâ€™s rich heritage. It aims to foster cultural appreciation through interactive exploration of art styles, traditions, and historical significance.

### **Features**
#### **Natural Language Query Handling**: 
Ask about Nigerian history, ethnic groups, art forms (e.g., Igbo-Ukwu bronzes, Yoruba Gele), or cultural practices, and receive accurate, context-aware responses.
#### **Real-Time Web Integration**:
Powered by Tavily, Heritage fetches the latest information to complement its knowledge base.
#### **Modular Architecture**:
Swap out components (e.g., data sources or themes) without altering the core structure, enabling easy customization.
